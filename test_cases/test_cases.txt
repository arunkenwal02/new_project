Here are the meaningful test cases designed to validate different aspects of the provided Python script:

### Test Case 1: Data Import Validation
- **Description:** This test case validates whether the dataset is imported correctly and contains the expected structure and data types.
- **How to Perform:**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    def test_data_import():
        df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
        assert df.shape[0] > 0, "DataFrame is empty."
        assert isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame), "Data import did not return a DataFrame."
        assert 'Personal_Loan' in df.columns, "'Personal_Loan' column is missing."
        assert df['Personal_Loan'].dtype in ['int64', 'object'], "'Personal_Loan' column has an unexpected data type."
    
    test_data_import()
    ```

### Test Case 2: Data Preprocessing Validation
- **Description:** This test case validates that the column names are correctly modified and that new features are created as intended.
- **How to Perform:**
    ```python
    def test_data_preprocessing():
        df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
        original_columns = df.columns.tolist()
        
        # Preprocessing step
        df.columns = [col.replace('.', '_') for col in df.columns]
        assert 'Age' in df.columns, "'Age' column is missing after preprocessing."
        
        df["Exp_Gap"] = df["Age"] - df["Experience"]
        assert 'Exp_Gap' in df.columns, "'Exp_Gap' feature was not created."
        assert df["Exp_Gap"].isnull().sum() == 0, "'Exp_Gap' contains null values."
    
    test_data_preprocessing()
    ```

### Test Case 3: Model Training Validation
- **Description:** This test case validates that the model training process completes successfully without errors.
- **How to Perform:**
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    
    def test_model_training():
        df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
        X = df.drop(['ZIP_Code', 'Personal_Loan', 'ID'], axis=1)  
        y = df['Personal_Loan']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        
        model = RandomForestClassifier()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        assert hasattr(model, 'feature_importances_'), "Model training did not complete successfully."
    
    test_model_training()
    ```

### Test Case 4: Predictions Validation
- **Description:** This test case validates that predictions can be made after training the model and checks the shape of the predictions.
- **How to Perform:**
    ```python
    def test_model_predictions():
        df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
        X = df.drop(['ZIP_Code', 'Personal_Loan', 'ID'], axis=1)  
        y = df['Personal_Loan']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        
        model = RandomForestClassifier()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        
        assert predictions.shape[0] == X_test.shape[0], "Predictions shape does not match test set shape."
    
    test_model_predictions()
    ```

### Test Case 5: Model Evaluation Validation
- **Description:** This test case validates that the model evaluation metrics are computed without errors and check that accuracy is a valid value.
- **How to Perform:**
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    
    def test_model_evaluation():
        df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
        X = df.drop(['ZIP_Code', 'Personal_Loan', 'ID'], axis=1)  
        y = df['Personal_Loan']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        
        model = RandomForestClassifier()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        assert 0 <= accuracy <= 1, "Accuracy is out of valid range."
    
    test_model_evaluation()
    ```

### Test Case 6: Hyperparameter Tuning Validation
- **Description:** This test case checks that the hyperparameter tuning process completes successfully and returns the best parameters.
- **How to Perform:**
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    
    def test_hyperparameter_tuning():
        df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
        X = df.drop(['ZIP_Code', 'Personal_Loan', 'ID'], axis=1)
        y = df['Personal_Loan']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        
        param_grid_rf = {
            'n_estimators': [10, 50, 100],
            'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
            'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
        }
        
        grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid_rf, cv=5)
        grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        assert grid_search.best_params_ is not None, "Best parameters were not found."
    
    test_hyperparameter_tuning()
    ```

These test cases cover the main functionalities of the provided script, ensuring that the data is processed correctly, models are trained and evaluated, and hyperparameter tuning is successful.
