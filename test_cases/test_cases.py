Here are the test cases based on the provided Python script:

- **Test Case 1: Data Import Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the data is imported correctly and the DataFrame is not empty.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Test for data import
    df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
    assert not df.empty, "DataFrame is empty, data import failed."
    assert isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame), "Imported object is not a DataFrame."
    ```

- **Test Case 2: Check for Null Values in DataFrame**
  - **Description**: Validates that there are no null values in the DataFrame.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    assert df.isnull().sum().sum() == 0, "DataFrame contains null values."
    ```

- **Test Case 3: Feature Engineering Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that new features are correctly created in the DataFrame.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    # Validate feature engineering
    original_shape = df.shape
    df["Exp_Gap"] = df["Age"] - df["Experience"]
    df["Income_per_Family"] = np.round(df["Income"] / (df["Family"].replace(0, 2)), 4)
    assert df.shape == original_shape, "Shape of DataFrame changed unexpectedly after feature engineering."
    assert "Exp_Gap" in df.columns, "Exp_Gap feature was not created."
    ```

- **Test Case 4: Model Training Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the models can be trained without errors.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

    X = df.drop(['ZIP_Code', 'Personal_Loan', 'ID'], axis=1)
    y = df['Personal_Loan']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Check if models can fit without error
    try:
        pipeline_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        pipeline_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
        pipeline_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
        pipeline_knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Model training failed with error: {e}"
    ```

- **Test Case 5: Predictions Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that predictions can be made and are of the expected shape.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    y_pred_rf = pipeline_rf.predict(X_test)
    assert y_pred_rf.shape == y_test.shape, "Predictions shape does not match the expected shape."
    ```

- **Test Case 6: Accuracy Score Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the accuracy scores are computed correctly and are within expected bounds.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    accuracy_rf = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_rf)
    assert 0 <= accuracy_rf <= 1, "Accuracy score is out of bounds [0, 1]."
    ```

- **Test Case 7: Hyperparameter Tuning Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that hyperparameter tuning can be executed without errors.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

    try:
        pipeline_rf_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Hyperparameter tuning failed with error: {e}"
    ```

- **Test Case 8: Best Hyperparameters Extraction Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the best hyperparameters are extracted correctly after tuning.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    best_params_rf = pipeline_rf_cv.named_steps['classifier'].best_params_
    assert best_params_rf is not None, "Best hyperparameters were not found."
    ```

- **Test Case 9: Model Evaluation Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the classification report can be generated without errors.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    try:
        classification_rep = classification_report(y_test, y_pred_rf_cv)
        assert isinstance(classification_rep, str), "Classification report is not in string format."
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Model evaluation failed with error: {e}"
    ```

These test cases cover key aspects of the script, including data import, preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation.
