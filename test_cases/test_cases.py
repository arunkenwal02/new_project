Here are some meaningful test cases based on the provided Python script:

- **Test Case 1: Data Import Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the data is imported correctly from the CSV file and that the DataFrame is not empty.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv('/Users/arunkenwal/Desktop/new_project/model_resources/bankloan.csv')
    assert not df.empty, "DataFrame is empty. Data import failed."
    ```

- **Test Case 2: Column Name Replacement Validation**
  - **Description**: Ensures that column names are correctly replaced by underscores instead of periods.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    df.columns = [col.replace('.', '_') for col in df.columns]
    assert all('.' not in col for col in df.columns), "Column name replacement failed."
    ```

- **Test Case 3: Feature Engineering Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that new features are correctly added to the DataFrame.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    expected_features = ["Exp_Gap", "Income_per_Family", "CC_Spend_Ratio", "Mortgage_Income_Ratio", 
                         "Income_Mortgage_Ratio", "Account_Score", "Digital_Score", 
                         "Income_Education", "Exp_Education", "CC_per_Family"]
    for feature in expected_features:
        assert feature in df.columns, f"Feature {feature} not found in DataFrame."
    ```

- **Test Case 4: Model Training Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the models are trained without errors and can make predictions.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    X = df.drop(['ZIP_Code', 'Personal_Loan', 'ID'], axis=1)
    y = df['Personal_Loan']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    pipelines = {
        'RandomForest': Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier())]),
        'SVM': Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('classifier', SVC())]),
        'LogisticRegression': Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('classifier', LogisticRegression())]),
        'KNN': Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('classifier', KNeighborsClassifier())])
    }

    for name, pipeline in pipelines.items():
        pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
        y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
        assert len(y_pred) == len(y_test), f"Model {name} failed to predict correctly."
    ```

- **Test Case 5: Model Accuracy Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the models achieve a reasonable accuracy score.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    accuracy_threshold = 0.5  # Example threshold

    for name, pipeline in pipelines.items():
        y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
        assert accuracy >= accuracy_threshold, f"Model {name} accuracy {accuracy} is below threshold."
    ```

- **Test Case 6: Hyperparameter Tuning Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that hyperparameter tuning is performed and best parameters are found.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

    param_grid_rf = {
        'n_estimators': [10, 50, 100],
        'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
        'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    }

    pipeline_rf_cv = Pipeline([
        ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
        ('classifier', GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid_rf, cv=5))
    ])

    pipeline_rf_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
    best_params_rf = pipeline_rf_cv.named_steps['classifier'].best_params_
    assert best_params_rf is not None, "Hyperparameter tuning failed to find best parameters."
    ```

- **Test Case 7: Classification Report Validation**
  - **Description**: Validates that the classification report is generated and contains expected metrics.
  - **How to Perform**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

    classification_rep = classification_report(y_test, y_pred_rf_cv)
    assert "precision" in classification_rep and "recall" in classification_rep, "Classification report is incomplete."
    ```

These test cases cover various aspects of the script, including data import, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
